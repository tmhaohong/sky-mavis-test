## What I did

- The UI matches the design 95%
- Use a theme to control the color
- Apply localization
- Create a simple REST API service
- Create a simple autocomplete input to show the top 5 To Addresses that we usually send the asset.
- Create a simple select input
- Create a simple number input
- Create a simple modal component


## What I will do:

- Add form validation
- Handle error messages
- Enhance autocomplete, select and number input
- Enhance modal component
- Control more styles in the theme


## What I need to do better:

- A context for the application, what is it used for?
- With the Figma components that the design has, it will be easy for me to create the ReactJS component

## What I think the design can improve:

- I don't know Ronin Wallet is the name of the application or the name of the wallet. I assume that it is the name of the wallet.
- The button length is not consistence, it is short in Unlock Screen but wide in the modal after sending the asset successfully.
- The modal size is not consistence, it is big  (full) in Assets Modal but small in the modal after sending the asset successfully.
- The asset input can be Radio for a quick-select
